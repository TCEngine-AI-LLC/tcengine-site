# The AIEM Stack™

**THE MISSION:** Protect National Military-Industrial Intellectual Property in the Digital Era.

Modern military advantage resides in software, data, and digital engineering environments. AI Export Modernization (AIEM) modernizes export controls into computable infrastructure capable of protecting intangible defense technologies while enabling secure global collaboration.

AIEM secures the intangible battlespace.

## The threat

Export controls were designed for physical exports.

The battlefield has moved to:

- source code
- models
- simulation environments
- additive manufacturing files
- cloud engineering ecosystems

Current reality:

- Network security ≠ data security
- PDFs ≠ enforcement
- Training ≠ control
- Audits occur after failure

Result:

- Consent Agreements
- Supply chain contraction
- Innovation slowdown
- National IP leakage

## The shift

Export compliance must evolve from:

**Policy → Workflow → Documentation**

to

**Architecture → Data Science → Infrastructure**

This shift is called: **AI Export Modernization (AIEM)**.

AIEM converts export regulation into a machine-executable control plane.
