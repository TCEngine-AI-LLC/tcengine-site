## The AIEM Platform

AIEM delivers three integrated capabilities:

### Architecture
Design of export-control operating models for digital engineering ecosystems.

### Data Science
Graph modeling, AI reasoning, and structured regulatory intelligence.

### Infrastructure
Deterministic enforcement embedded directly into enterprise environments.

### The outcome

Organizations achieve:

- ✅ Deterministic export compliance  
- ✅ Reduced consent agreement risk  
- ✅ Secure international collaboration  
- ✅ Faster engineering velocity  
- ✅ Zero Trust convergence  
- ✅ Protection of national military advantage  

Export controls are not a compliance function. They are industrial security infrastructure.
