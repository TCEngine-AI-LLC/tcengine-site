## Overview

### Protecting National Military-Industrial Intellectual Property in the AI Era

We deliver AI Export Modernization (AIEM) — the architecture, data science, and infrastructure required to govern software, technical data, and digital engineering environments across the global defense industrial base.

Export controls move from paperwork to **deterministic enforcement infrastructure**.

Modern military advantage lives in code, models, and collaboration networks.
AIEM secures the intangible battlespace.

## The problem
### Export Controls Were Built for Hardware. The Threat Has Moved to Data.

Today’s most sensitive technologies exist as:
- Software repositories
- Digital engineering models
- AI systems
- Manufacturing files
- Cloud collaboration environments

Legacy compliance cannot control intangible exports at scale.

## The shift
### AI Export Modernization (AIEM)

AIEM transforms export regulation into **National Industrial IP Defense Infrastructure**.

Not compliance software.  
Not workflow automation.

A control plane for controlled technology.

## Who we serve
- Defense Industrial **Base**
- Space Systems
- Autonomous Platforms
- Advanced Manufacturing
- Allied Industrial Cooperation

## The real secret
We deliver **export control infrastructure**.
